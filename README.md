Website - [TroyDev](http://sebastiantroy.github.io/OldWebsite/).
=======

This is no longer my website, however it does contain some interesting knick-knacks so I have maintained it here for posterity.

My website is basically a portfolio for my programming work and contains a dedicated page for each of [my projects](http://sebastiantroy.github.io/OldWebsite/projects.php).
