			<div class="content">
				<p>My name is Sebastian Troy, I'm 22 years old and I was born and raised in the south of
					England. During my time at university I began to discover my obsession with programming, I find
					the creative freedom combined with hard logic completely irresistable. I've been teaching
					myself programming for a little over 3 years now, between doing my degree and various summer
					jobs, and I am currently looking for a foothold in the game development industry.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>I am completely self taught, having accessed tutorials and demo code from online sources
					I am very adept at picking up new concepts, rationalising other peoples code and leaving
					coherent comments throughout my work.</p>
				<p>
					The language I have most experience with is Java though I am capable of programming in C++,
					Python, javascript and I am currently learning a new language called <a
						href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust.</a>. Building this website has considerably increased
					my skills in css, html and php.

			<div class="content">
				<p>My real passion is game development, I find it offers the broadest variety of challenges,
					not limited to programming, which I relish in developing tidy and elegant solutions for. While
					certainly happy to work on the problems offered by other people and media, I aspire to play a
					creative role in every aspect of the development of games as a lead designer/engineer,
					eventualy of my own company.</p>
