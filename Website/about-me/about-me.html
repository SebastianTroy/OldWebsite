					or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sebastian-troy/a2/b1b/799">find me on LinkedIn</a>. I also have a <a

				<p>The language I now have most experience with is C++ though most of my initial projects and experience were in
					Java. Building this website has considerably increased my skills in CSS, HTML and PHP, however web development skills
					are not a particular focus of mine.</p>
