			<h1 class="box_heading">Animal Evolution Simulation</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>This projects aims to model animal evolution through natural selection. It does this by simulating an environment
					in which animal like entities grow and reproduce, while competing for food.</p>
				<p>In normal genetic algorithms there are distinct stages or generations:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Generate a random population.</li>
					<li>Test them all using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">fitness function</a>.
					</li>
					<li>Select a fit portion of the population, based on the fitness function.</li>
					<li>Create the next generation from the fit individuals, usually by copying them and adding small mutations to
						some.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In this program however there is no fitness function and there are no set generations. Instead the fitness of an
					individual can be considered to be how many offspring it manages to have. There is no equivalent to generations because,
					as in real life, some creatures will outlive others and successfully have offspring before or after each other.</p>
				<p>In any situation where you have variation in a population, inheritable traits, mutation and variable survival you
					will get evolution, it is unavoidable and can be applied in any situation in which those traits all exist together.</p>

					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">What Am I Looking At?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Each organism, or 'swimmer', is represented by a coloured circle. The open circles represent senses that detect
							other entities within their area. The straight line points directly forwards and detects a single entity touching it,
							the closest to the swimmer. Food particles are represented by green circles.</p>
						<p>Each swimmer can only detect items within the range of its senses.</p>
						<p>The right hand column contains a graph. The axis are rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which means the (0, 0) is the
							top left, the y-axis runs along the top, and the x-axis runs down the left edge. The green line represents the energy
							contained by all existing food pellets, the blue line represents the energy held by all existing swimmers. There is no
							fixed quantity of energy however there is a limited spawn rate for food pellets. As swimmers become more efficient at
							finding food, they should eat the pellets more quickly, and waste less energy, shifting the balance of energy further
							from green to blue.</p>
						<p>The bottom panel contains an inspector, this allows a selected entity to be analysed. The boxes along the top
							represent each of the sensory inputs a swimmer has, the middle big box is its brain, and the box along the bottom is
							its tail (or tails if it has evolved more than one!). The colour of a node represents its value, red is negative, blue
							is positive, the transparency denotes the size of the value. The values are usually between -1 (opaque red) to 1
							(opaque blue), however if a value is bigger the node gets drawn larger. The connections can also be positive or
							negative. The width represents the size of the connection and the transparency represents the current usage of the
							connection.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">The Genetics</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>
							A swimmer's genetics are quite complex. A genome can contain one or more chromosomes, which in turn can contain one or
							more genes. Chromosomes exist in pairs, like in real life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a>.
							When combining genomes, each swimmer parent contributes a single chromosome from each pair, so that a child recieves
							two copies of each gene (for a-sexual reproduction, the single parent's genome is copied and treated like two genomes
							from separate parents).
						</p>
						<p>Currently the following genes exist:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>GenePigment: Contributes to the final colour of the swimmer,</li>
							<li>GeneBrain: Contains the complete description of the main neural network for the swimmer,</li>
							<li>GeneSenseTraitsInArea: Adds a circular sense that detects all other entities within an area,</li>
							<li>GeneSenseTraitsRaycast: Adds a line sense that detects the single nearest entity that is colliding with the
								line,</li>
							<li>GeneSenseTraitsSelf: Adds a sense that measures certain aspects of the swimmers own state,</li>
							<li>GeneSenseTraitsTouching: Adds a sense that detects all entities colliding with a single point,</li>
							<li>GeneSenseMagneticField: Adds a sense that indicates the angle to (0, 0) and the distance to it,</li>
							<li>GeneSenseRandom: Adds a sense that detects a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low
									pass filter</a>ed number. The filter helps the value to change more gradually,
							</li>
							<li>GeneSenseSine: Adds a sense that detects a constantly oscillating number, based on a <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sine wave</a></li>
							<li>GeneEffectorTail: Adds an effector that allows the entity to move forwards, and turn left or right.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">The Interface</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>The interface is currently very simple, left click & drag to move, scroll to zoom. You can also right click on a
							swimmer to select it. When a swimmer is selected, the "Brain Inspector" view on the right will populate, and some
							details about the swimmer will be displayed.</p>
						<p>Note that there are invisible handles between each section that can be used to adjust the sizes of the panels,
							this is a bug in Qt, there is a plan to work around it by drawing a custom handle. For now the mouse will change from
							a pointer to a resize arrow when it is over the handle.</p>
						<div class="box_break"></div>
						<ul>
							<li>Settings:
								<ul>
									<li>Reset: Removes all entities, sets time to 0 and respawns the default feeders and a number of default
										swimmers.</li>
									<li>Spawn Food: A toggle switch, when pressed down (default) food will spawn in the simulation. When lifted,
										food will stop spawning.</li>
									<li>Select Fittest: Searches the simulation for the swimmer with the most living descendants and selects it.</li>
									<li>Follow: Each tick the Universe's view is adjusted so the selected swimmer is always in the centre.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Simulation:
								<ul>
									<li>The mouse can be used to pan (left mouse button, click and drag), zoom (scroll wheel), and select a swimmer
										(right mouse button).</li>
									<li>Pause: A toggle switch, the simulation will not progressed when this button is down.</li>
									<li>Limit: A toggle switch, when pressed down, the simulation will not delay between ticks (default).</li>
									<li>TPS: "Ticks per Second" The value in this box is the maximum number of simulation ticks to be computed per
										second. The limit is only applied if "Limit" (button to the left) is pressed down.</li>
									<li>FPS: "Frames per Second" The value in this box is the number of times the simulation draws itself each
										second. A higher value will result in smoother animation. A lower value will allow ticks to be computed more
										rapidly.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Brain Inspector:
								<ul>
									<li>The mouse can be used to pan (left mouse button, click and drag), zoom (scroll wheel).</li>
									<li>Reset View: Re-centres the view of the neural network, and scales it to fit the entire network in the area.</li>
									<li>UpdateLive: When checked, this option will calculate what the selected swimmer is sensing and re-draw the
										swimmers brain each tick. Blue nodes have a positive value, red nodes have a negative value. Connections can also
										be positive or negative, wider connections have a larger value, transparent connections are not currently in use.
										Sometimes a node will grow larger than normal, this implies it has a value > 1.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Graphs:
								<ul>
									<li>Energy: The combined ammount of energy contained by all of a particular entity type. Currently the green
										line represents food pellet energy, and the blue line represents swimmer energy.</li>
									<li>Mean Age: The average age (in ticks) of a particular energy type. Again green for food pellets, blue for
										swimmers.</li>
									<li>Oldest: Tracks the age of the oldest entity for each type. An increasing diagonal line represents the
										continued aging of the current oldest entity. A drop implies that the oldest entity died and the age of the next
										oldest entity is lower.</li>

						<p>Under the hood there have been a lot of tweaks to the genetics, improving the scope of what can mutate and
							evolve. Swimmers also now have "health" which can if completely lost, cause a swimmer to die. A swimmer that died from
							lack of health will transmute any remaining energy into a collection of "MeatChunks", and while there isn't anything
							that interactes with them yet, the intent is to allow predation to be a viable survival strategy in future updates.</p>

							<li>Swimmers now have a notion of their health, when below 100% they will expend energy to heal, when it reaches
								0% they die,</li>
							<li>If a swimmer dies with more than 0 energy, the energy is converted into meat chunks, which slowly decay if
								uneaten,</li>
							<li>Lunar cycle, as yet unused but will be an available sense going forward, hopefully allowing disparate
								swimmers to coordinate behaviour,</li>
							<li>Base metabolism, swimmers now have a variable basic energy usage per tick, based on the size and complexity
								of their senses and effectors,</li>
							<li>Graphs are now configurable,</li>
							<li>New graphs, showing lunar cycle stage, average health, average metabolism, swimmer generation number and

						<p>The next stage of the project was to create a distributable release. Once this had been achieved, it was evident
							that a more polished set of controls were needed. This update therefore not only allows you to download and tinker

						<p>Major features:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Each swimmer has a fully simulated genome. Genes add abilities to the swimmer, like senses, pigments or
								limbs,</li>
							<li>Swimmers can combine their genomes to reproduce sexually, or they can reproduce a-sexually,</li>
							<li>A graph documents the total energy contained within all food pellets (green line) and all swimmers (blue
								line),</li>
							<li>The inner workings of a swimmer's neural network can be observed live, including all of the sensory inputs
								and all of the effector outputs,</li>
							<li>Swimmers can be followed, and the most fit swimmer can automatically be selected each time it changes.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This build is also notably lacking many things, next priorities include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An executable! So far the only way to run this is to build it yourself,</li>
							<li>Buttons! The GUI needs fleshing out, especially if I start distributing an executable,</li>
							<li>The ability for swimmers to eat each other,</li>
							<li>Entities need to be movable and create-able,</li>
