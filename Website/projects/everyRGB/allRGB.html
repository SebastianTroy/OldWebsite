			<div class="content">
				<p>
					This project was inspired by <a href="http://allrgb.com/">allRGB.com</a> and by my previous work with <a
						href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>.
				</p>
				<p>There are 16,777,216 8 bit RGB colours. If you made an image that contained each colour exactly once it would be a
					4096 by 4096 pixel square. This program takes an image of your choice and then tries to generate an image that uses only
					one of each colour that matches it. This is a huge feat as the image size is so large, finding the best match for the
					entire image would require millions of operations performed upon millions of pixels. Rather than taking a long time to find
					an exact answer, this program uses a genetic algorithm to work towards an acceptable solution in a much shorter period
					of time.</p>
				<p>The general flow of the program is:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>User loads an image.</li>
					<li>The image is stretched to be exactly 4095x4095 pixels.</li>
					<li>An image that contains one of every colour is created.</li>
					<li>Two pixels in the allRGB image are chosen at random</li>
					<li>Work out how closely they match the reference image</li>
					<li>Work out how closely they would match the reference image if they were swapped around</li>
					<li>If the swap incurs an improvement, swap them</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 4-7 until the user is happy with the result.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Each time the program gets from step 4 to step 7 counts as a generation, each time the pixels are swapped counts
					as an improvement.</p>
				<p>The simplicity of the algorithm means that many thousands of checks and swaps can be made every second. This,
					combined with the random coverage of the image, quickly leads to the visible improvement of the solution.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p>When you run the program you should see two images. The image on the left is the 'reference image' this is the
							image which the algorithm attempts to copy using exactly 1 of each colour. The image on the right is the 'allRGB
							image' this is the image which the algorithm works on, it will keep on evolving the image in an attempt to make it
							match the reference image.</p>
						<p>Neither of the images will be shown full size on your screen because they are huge, this means that Java scales
							them down to make them fit. This scaling reduces the quality of the image which means saving the image to your
							computer and opening it in a photo viewer is the only way to really see the result of the algorithm.</p>
						<p>At the top of the screen are some numbers:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Gen: </b>This is the number of 'generations' i.e. the number of times the genetic algorithm has been run.</li>
							<li><b>Improvements: </b>This is the number of generations in which the mutation has been positive. When a new
								image is first loaded, this number should be close to the number of generations however as time goes by and more
								improvements are made, it becomes harder to find a beneficial mutation and therefore the rate at which improvements
								are made will decrease.</li>
							<li><b>FPS: </b>This is the number of 'frames per second' which is the number of times the entire program runs
								each second.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">The Interface</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Unfortunately in this version the user interface is very basic.</p>
						<p>Image on the left:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Left click: </b>Load a reference image, the image will be scaled to 4096x4096 pixels.</li>
							<li><b>Right click: </b>Save the reference image.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Image on the Right:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Left click: </b>
								<ul>
									<li>You are given the option to reset the allRGB image, this will wipe all progress.</li>
									<li>If you decline the first option, you are asked if you'd like to load an image, combined with the save
										feature this allows you reload old allRGB images so you can continue to improve them.</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li><b>Right click: </b>Save the allRGB image.</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="content">
						<p>While not enough progress has been made to publish an interactive version, I've been working on a better
							interface and a few slightly modified versions of the algorithm.</p>
						<p>
							The easiest modification is simply to look for the worst match for each pixel rather than the best, this results in a
							negative of the image being produced. I'm also working on an <i>exact</i> version of the algorithm that looks for the
							closest match for a pixel out of all the remaining colours, however due to the very large number of comparisons that
							need to be made, it is extremely slow.
