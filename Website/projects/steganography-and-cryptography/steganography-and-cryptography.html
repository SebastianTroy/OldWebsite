			<div class="content">
				<p>
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> is the art of hiding information in images, <a
						href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a> is the practice of hiding information from
					adversaries. I was interested in creating an unbreakable and undetectable encryption so I began by looking into 1) how
					information was discerned from noise and 2) how codes were cracked.
				</p>
				<p>Basically both of those problems are the same, Hidden information is found and codes are cracked by finding
					patterns. This can be got around by having no pattern, or at least having so many ways to encode each letter of the
					alphabet, each character is encoded in a unique hash. In this way, a long string of encoded Zs would not leave a
					repeating pattern which could be detected.</p>
				<p>The information is encoded 16 bits of data, therefore 65536 different unique characters can be encoded, if we only
					want to encode 26 letters of the alphabet, spaces and some character to signify the end of the message, that leaves us
					with 2340 possible permutations per letter. The information is then hidden in the images in a 4x4 pixel grid pattern.
					Each pixel in the image is represented by an integer which can be odd or even, if you read even as 0 and odd as 1 you
					have binary information.</p>
				<p>28 unique characters can be stored using only 5 bits of data, therefore the process of increasing the number of
					bits used to store each character could be seen as hashing. To convert a message into string of hashes, a neural network
					and backwards engineering is used. A random 16bit configuration is chosen, passed through the neural net and the if it
					is needed, the character it represents is inserted into the message, this process is repeated until each character in
					the message has a random 16 bit hash assigned. This makes decrypting the message easy, if you have the correct neural
					network, simply pass each hash through the network and voila, your secret message!</p>
				<p>Of course, if you don't have the neural network, all you'll see is an image, and even if you know there is a
					message inside it, the chances of the message containing two identical 16 bit hashes is small. A message which is 3000
					characters long would therefore look like it was written in a language which used 3000 letters in its alphabet. The
					network used to create the hashes is highly sensitive to even small tweaks to its structure, so much so that even a
					single node with an altered threshold will output gibberish that is impossible to replicate without the original
					parameters.</p>

					<li>Due to the nature of the encryption any form of image compression will destroy the hidden message therefore
						sending an image with a secret message over Facebook will not work.</li>

						being exposed while using my encryption method.

					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">Simple instructions</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<ul>
							<li>Rename a .png or .jpg to a message that you want hidden inside it</li>
							<li>For ease of use, move the image into the same folder as the program</li>
							<li>Run the program, select the image and click "OK"</li>
							<li>Click "Cancel" to finish or select another file to encode it as well</li>
							<li>You will find your image has been renamed, you can now change it to whatever you like and your secret message
								is safe</li>
							<li>To retrieve your message Run the program again Select the image and click "OK"</li>
							<li>You will find your image has been renamed back to the original message that you encoded (minus punctuation or
								capital letters).</li>

					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">Advanced instructions</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>To run the program from a command line or console, open the console to the location of the program and type
							"java -jar Encrypto.jar" You can also add extra arguments to the JVM for extra features of the program, "java -jar
							[add your arguments here] Encrypto.jar" these are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>'-Dseed=integer' This allows you to specify your own seed, used to construct the Neural Network, messages
								encoded with a seed can only be decoded with exactly the same seed allowing for "passkey" protected messages (default
								value if unspecified == 1198662804)</li>
							<li>'-Dleeway=float' This allows you to control the inner workings of the Network used to encode and decode
								messages, again changing this value will change how the network translates information. This value is very sensitive
								and it is recommended that you use some of the other modes in order to refine this variable if you intend to change
								it. (default value if unspecified == 0.07)</li>
							<li>'-Dmode=mode' This allows you to change what mode the program is run in which are:
								<ul>
									<li><b>dictionary</b>, this mode simply cycles through every combination 16 bits can represent and prints out
										the character that the Network represents it as. This can be helpful in assessing how randomly our Network is
										assigning characters to our 16 bit combinations</li>
									<li><b>stats</b>, this mode calculates the frequency of combinations that represent each letter of the
										alphabet, it then prints out the Standard Deviation of the frequencies and also an array representing the % of
										combinations used for each letter. A pseudo random distribution of frequencies would result in a standard deviation
										of roughly 100 though 400 is a good number to aim for when choosing a seed.</li>
									<li><b>optimise</b>, this mode allows you to search for a seed with a low standard deviation for a particular
										setup, you can specify the 'levels' used in the Network and the 'leeway' with the above parameters.</li>
									<li><b>graph</b>, this mode draws a graph to an image and saves it to your desktop. This mode is most useful
										for narrowing down an appropriate 'leeway' value. The graph shows the standard deviation for a range of Networks
										with leeway set between:
										<ul>
											<li>'-Dminleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.0)</li>
											<li>'-Dmaxleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.4)</li>
										</ul></li>
								</ul>

						<p>This version is very simple, in the future I intend to make it more user friendly however it works and for now I

						<p>Messages can be hidden in messages and retrieved from them. The program reads any information hidden in the
							message and grabs the name of the image and then swaps them round, hiding the name in the image and renaming it to
							anything hidden in the image.</p>
