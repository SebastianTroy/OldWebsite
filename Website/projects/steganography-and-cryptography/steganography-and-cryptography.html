				<p>This project combines the hiding of information in images alongside the encryption of information. I was
					interested in creating an unbreakable and undetectable encryption, so I began by looking into 1) how information was
					discerned from noise and 2) how codes were cracked.</p>
				<p>Basically both of those problems are the same, codes are cracked by looking for patterns and this can be got
					around by having many ways to represent each character of the alphabet. In this way, a long string of encoded "z"s would
					not leave a repeating pattern which could be detected.</p>
				<p>The information is encoded in images in a 4x4 pixel grid pattern, each pixel has a colour represented by an
					integer which can be odd or even, binary! 4x4 means 16 bits of data, therefore 65536 different unique permutations, if
					we only want to encode 26 letters of the alphabet, spaces and some character to signify the end of the message, that
					leaves us with 2340 possible permutations per letter.</p>
				<p>28 unique characters can be stored in only 5 bits of data, therefore the process of inflating number of bits to
					store each character could be seen as a hash. To convert a message into string of hashes, a neural network and backwards
					engineering is used. A random 16bit configuration is chosen, passed through the neural net and the character it
					represents is inserted into the message, this process is repeated until each character in the message has a random 16
					bit hash assigned. This makes decrypting the message easy, if you have the correct neural network, simply pass each hash
					through the network and voila, your secret message!</p>
				<p>Of course, if you don't have the neural network, all you'll see is an image, and even if you know there is a
					message inside it, the chances of the message containing two identical 16 bit hashes is small. The network used to
					create the hashes is highly sensitive to even small tweaks to its structure, so much so that even a single node with an
					altered threshold will output gibberish, impossible to replicate without the original parameters.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<ul>
							<li>Rename a .png or .jpg to a message that you want hidden inside it</li>
							<li>Run the program (From the same directory as the image is the easiest way to locate your image file) Select
								the image and click "OK"</li>
							<li>Click "Cancel" to finish or select another file to encode it as well</li>
							<li>You will find your image has been renamed, you can now change it to whatever you like and your secret message
								is safe</li>
							<li>To retrieve your message Run the program again Select the image and click "OK"</li>
							<li>You will find your image has been renamed back to the original message that you encoded (minus punctuation or
								capital letters).</li>

					<div class="content">
						<p>To run the program from a command line or console, open the console to the location of the program and type
							"java -jar Encrypto.jar" You can also add extra arguments to the JVM for extra features of the program, "java -jar
							[add your arguments here] Encrypto.jar" these are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>'-Dseed=integer' This allows you to specify your own seed, used to construct the Neural Network, messages
								encoded with a seed can only be decoded with exactly the same seed allowing for "passkey" protected messages (default
								value if unspecified == 1198662804)</li>
							<li>'-Dleeway=float' This allows you to control the inner workings of the Network used to encode and decode
								messages, again changing this value will change how the network translates information. This value is very sensitive
								and it is recommended that you use some of the other modes in order to refine this variable if you intend to change
								it. (default value if unspecified == 0.07)</li>
							<li>'-Dmode=mode' This allows you to change what mode the program is run in which are:
								<ul>
									<li><b>dictionary</b>, this mode simply cycles through every combination 16 bits can represent and prints out
										the character that the Network represents it as. This can be helpful in assessing how randomly our Network is
										assigning characters to our 16 bit combinations</li>
									<li><b>stats</b>, this mode calculates the frequency of combinations that represent each letter of the
										alphabet, it then prints out the Standard Deviation of the frequencies and also an array representing the % of
										combinations used for each letter. A pseudo random distribution of frequencies would result in a standard deviation
										of roughly 100 though 400 is a good number to aim for when choosing a seed.</li>
									<li><b>optimise</b>, this mode allows you to search for a seed with a low standard deviation for a particular
										setup, you can specify the 'levels' used in the Network and the 'leeway' with the above parameters.</li>
									<li><b>graph</b>, this mode draws a graph to an image and saves it to your desktop. This mode is most useful
										for narrowing down an appropriate 'leeway' value. The graph shows the standard deviation for a range of Networks
										with leeway set between:
										<ul>
											<li>'-Dminleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.0)</li>
											<li>'-Dmaxleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.4)</li>
										</ul></li>
								</ul>
