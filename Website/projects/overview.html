			<h1 class="box_heading">Fluid Dynamics ~ July 2014</h1>

				<p>This project represents the fluid portion of a marine plankton ecological model I worked
					on for my dissertation. The project shows a 2D simulation of an incompressible fluid. This
					fluid can be interacted with by the user, similar to putting your hand in water and sloshing it
					about.</p>

			<h1 class="box_heading">EveryRGB ~ April 2014</h1>

				<p>
					This project was inspired by <a href="http://allrgb.com/">allRGB.com</a> and by my previous
					work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>.
				</p>
				<p>There are 16,777,216 8 bit RGB colours,the leads to an image which is 4096x4096 pixels,
					this is a huge image so it takes many millions of generations for random improvements to
					improve every pixel in the image at least once. The genetic algorithm randomly chooses two
					pixels and calculates their fitness, that is how closely they match the colour of the pixels in
					the image being copied, then it calculates the fitness for the pixels if they were swapped and
					swaps them if an improvement is made.</p>
				<p>The simplicity of the algorithm means that many thousands of checks and swaps can be made
					every second, this, combined with the random coverage of the image, quickly leads to the
					visible improvement of the solution</p>

			<h1 class="box_heading">Steganography &amp; Cryptography ~ Febuary 2014</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>This project combines the hiding of information in images alongside the encryption of
					information. I was interested in creating an unbreakable and undetectable encryption, so I
					began by looking into 1) how information was discerned from noise and 2) how codes were
					cracked.</p>
				<p>Basically both of those problems are the same, codes are cracked by looking for patterns
					and this can be got around by having many ways to represent each character of the alphabet. In
					this way, a long string of encoded "z"s would not leave a repeating pattern which could be
					detected.</p>
				<p>The information is encoded in images in a 4x4 pixel grid pattern, each pixel has a colour
					represented by an integer which can be odd or even, binary! 4x4 means 16 bits of data,
					therefore 65536 different unique permutations, if we only want to encode 26 letters of the
					alphabet, spaces and some character to signify the end of the message, that leaves us with 2340
					possible permutations per letter.</p>
				<p>28 unique characters can be stored in only 5 bits of data, therefore the process of
					inflating number of bits to store each hcaracter could be seen as a hash. To convert a message
					into string of hashes, a neural network and backwards engineering is used. A random 16bit
					configuration is chosen, passed through the neural net and the character it represents is
					inserted into the message, this process is repeated until each character in the message has a
					random 16 bit hash assigned. This makes decrypting the message easy, if you have the correct
					neural network, simply pass each hash through the network and voila, your secret message!</p>
				<p>Of course, if you don't have the neural network, all you'll see is an image, and even if
					you know there is a message inside it, the chances of the message containing two identical 16
					bit hashes is small. The network used to create the hashes is highly sensitive to even small
					tweaks to its structure, so much so that even a single node with an altered threshold will
					output gibberish, impossible to replicate without the original parameters.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Rename a .png or .jpg to a message that you want hidden inside it</li>

								your image file) Select the image and click "OK"</li>
							<li>Click "Cancel" to finish or select another file to encode it as well</li>
							<li>You will find your image has been renamed, you can now change it to whatever you
								like and your secret message is safe</li>

				<div class="box">
					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">Advanced instructions</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>To run the program from a command line or console, open the console to the location of
							the program and type "java -jar Encrypto.jar" You can also add extra arguments to the JVM for
							extra features of the program, "java -jar [add your arguments here] Encrypto.jar" these are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>'-Dseed=integer' This allows you to specify your own seed, used to construct the
								Neural Network, messages encoded with a seed can only be decoded with exactly the same seed
								allowing for "passkey" protected messages (default value if unspecified == 1198662804)</li>
							<li>'-Dleeway=float' This allows you to controll the inner workings of the Network used
								to encode and decode messages, again changing this value will change how the network
								translates information. This value is very sensitive and it is reccomended that you use some
								of the other modes in order to refine this variable if you intend to change it. (default
								value if unspecified == 0.07)</li>
							<li>'-Dmode=mode' This allows you to change what mode the program is run in which are:
								<ul>
									<li><b>dictionary</b>, this mode simply cycles through every combination 16 bits can
										represent and prints out the character that the Network represents it as. This can be
										helpful in assesing how randomly our Network is assigning characters to our 16 bit
										combinations</li>
									<li><b>stats</b>, this mode calculates the frequency of combinations that represent
										each letter of the alphabet, it then prints out the Standard Deviation of the frequencies
										and also an array representing the % of combinations used for each letter. A psuedo random
										distribution of frequencies would result in a standard deviation of roughly 100 though 400
										is a good number to aim for when chosing a seed.</li>
									<li><b>optimise</b>, this mode allows you to search for a seed with a low standard
										deviation for a particular setup, you can specify the 'levels' used in the Network and the
										'leeway' with the above parameters.</li>
									<li><b>graph</b>, this mode draws a graph to an image and saves it to your desktop.
										This mode is most useful for narrowing down an appropriate 'leeway' value. The graph shows
										the standard deviation for a range of Networks with leeways set between
										<ul>
											<li>'-Dminleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.0)</li>
											<li>'-Dmaxleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.4)</li>
										</ul></li>
