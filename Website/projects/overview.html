				<p>This project combines the hiding of information in images alongside the encryption of information. Using a neural
					network it hashes each character in a message and then integrates the binary data into the image in a way that doesn't
					noticeably disrupt the image colours. The nature of the hashing attempts to disguise the data as random noise, which in
					theory makes the hidden message undetectable. Unfortunately, due to image compression, the lack of uniformity actually</p>
