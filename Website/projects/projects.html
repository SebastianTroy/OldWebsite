			<h1 class="box_heading">Fluid Dynamics ~ July 2014</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>This project is a spin-off from the modelling work I did for my undergraduate
					dissertation. The model aims to represent an incompressible fluid, e.g. water, in a quick but
					physically realistic manner.</p>
				<p>
					The images on the right show a few of the possible ways that the fluid can be visualised. The
					water is simulated using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a>,
					the arrows represent the direction and speed of flow at a particular point in the simulation
					and the particles act as tracers for individual molecules of the fluid.
				</p>
				<p>
					The method I used is based on work done by Jos Stam, his original document can be found <a
						href="http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf">here</a>.

				<ul>
					<li>To interact with the fluid, simply click and drag the mouse cursor through the model.</li>
					<li>Vector line Density: This only controls how many of the vectors are drawn, it doesn't
						change the number of vectors being modelled.</li>
					<li>Time between Calculations (s): This adds a delay, in seconds, between each step of the
						model, this slows the speed at which the model is calculated and drawn.</li>
					<li>Iterations of linear solving: This variable is more complex. If your computer can
						handle it, 6 is a good value. Anything below 6 results in unrealistic and less interesting
						behaviour of the fluid however on older computers it might be necessary to turn it down as it
						is a major bottleneck.</li>
					<li>Particle diffusion: This value is used to determine the random movements of all of the
						particles within the model. At 0 all particles act as perfect tracers however this can lead to
						all of the particles getting stuck at the top and bottom edges of the model.</li>
					<li>Particle brightness: Allows the choice of a particle colour between white and blue.</li>

					This project was inspired by <a href="http://allrgb.com/">allRGB.com</a> and by my previous
					work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>.
				</p>
				<p>There are 16,777,216 8 bit RGB colours,the leads to an image which is 4096x4096 pixels,
					this is a huge image so it takes many millions of generations for random improvements to
					improve every pixel in the image at least once. The genetic algorithm randomly chooses two
					pixels and calculates their fitness, that is how closely they match the colour of the pixels in
					the image being copied, then it calculates the fitness for the pixels if they were swapped and
					swaps them if an improvement is made.</p>
				<p>The simplicity of the algorithm means that many thousands of checks and swaps can be made
					every second, this, combined with the random coverage of the image, quickly leads to the
					visible improvement of the solution</p>

					<li>Resize the window untill only the generation and number of improvements are visible to
						speed up the program.</li>
					<li>The images shown in the program often seem much worse quality than they are in
						reality, save the image and view in another program for a better look.</li>
					<li>To replace either of the images, left click on them, this will allow you to load an
						image, which will automatically be resized to 4096x4096</li>
					<li>To save either of the images, right click on them. <strong>Warning</strong> when right
						clicking on the right image, you are first asked whether you wish to reset it to the default
						image.

					<li>My reason for not including a gui was performance, I intend to revisit this project
						and implement a more intuitive interface.</li>
