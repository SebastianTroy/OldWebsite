			<h1>Fluid Dynamics ~ July 2014</h1>
			<p>This project is a spin-off from the modelling work I did for
				my undergraduate dissertation. The model aims to represent an
				incompressible fluid, e.g. water, in a quick but physically
				realistic manner.</p>
			<p>
				The images on the right show a few of the possible ways that the
				fluid can be visualised. The water is simulated using a <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a>,
				the arrows represent the direction and speed of flow at a particular
				point in the simulation and the particles act as tracers for
				individual mollecules of the fluid.
			</p>
			<p>
				The method I used is based on work done by Jos Stam, his origional
				document can be found <a
					href="http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is written in java and is completely open source. You
				can download and run it from <a
					href="https://github.com/SebastianTroy/Particle-Model-Java/raw/2D-only/Particle-Model-Java/FluidApp.jar">here
					[FluidApp.jar]</a>, (you'll need java installed), and you can get the
				source code <a
					href="https://github.com/SebastianTroy/Particle-Model-Java/tree/2D-only">here
					[github]</a>.

			<ul>
				<li>To interact with the fluid, simply click and drag the mouse
					cursor through the model.</li>
				<li>Vector line Density: This only controls how many of the
					vectors are drawn, it doesn't change the number of vectors being
					modelled.</li>
				<li>Time between Calculations (s): This adds a delay, in
					seconds, between each step of the model, this slows the speed at
					which the model is calculated and drawn.</li>
				<li>Iteratios of linear solving: This variable is more complex.
					If your computer can handle it, 6 is a good value. Anything below 6
					results in unrealistic and less interesting behaviour of the fluid
					however on older computers it might be necessary to turn it down as
					it is a major bottleneck.</li>
				<li>Particle diffusion: This value is used to determine the
					random movements of all of the particles within the model. At 0 all
					particles act as perfect tracers however this can lead to all of
					the particles getting stuck at the top and bottom edges of the
					model.</li>
				<li>Particle brightness: Allows the choice of a particle colour
					between white and blue.</li>

			<h1>EveryRGB ~ April 2014</h1>
			<p>
				This project was inspired by <a href="http://allrgb.com/">allRGB.com</a>
				and by my previous work with <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic
					algorithms</a>.
			</p>
			<p>There are 16,777,216 8 bit RGB colours,the leads to an image
				which is 4096x4096 pixels, this is a huge image so it takes many
				millions of generations for random improvements to improve every
				pixel in the image at least once. The genetic algoritm randomly
				chooses two pixels and calculates their fitness, that is how closely
				they match the colour of the pixels in the image being copied, then
				it calculates the fitness for the pixels if they were swapped and
				swaps them if an improvement is made.</p>
			<p>The simplicity of the algorithm means that many thousands of
				checks and swaps can be made every second, this, combined with the
				random coverage of the image, quickly leads to the visible
				improvement of the solution</p>
			<p>
				The project is written in java and is completely open source. You
				can download and run it from <a
					href="https://github.com/SebastianTroy/allRGB/raw/master/EveryRGBPictureMatcher/all%20RGB%20hillclimber.jar">here
					[allRGB.jar]</a>, (you'll need java installed), and you can get the
