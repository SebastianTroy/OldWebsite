					The program is a complex genetic algorithm where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">fitness

						<p>I've always thought that the older versions, while slow and full of unnecessary features, managed to capture
							something that the newer program did not. The new program has to be run at ridiculously high speeds in order to
							observe evolution happening and then it is usually very stochastic and leads to very boring shapes emerging.</p>
						<p>For that reason I've revisited one of the older programs, the one that simulates recombination of genetic
							material from two parents</p>
						<p>So far the progress has mostly been updating it to use a newer version of my interface library and removing a
							few features that don't add anything to the simulation.</p>

						<p>I've been playing around with the way that genes work and the result is this new branch of the program. It is
							based on 2.0 but completely changes the way that genes work. The genes still define the exact shape that the plant
							will grow into but they are far more simple and complex at the same time.</p>
						<p>The idea is that some characters in a gene stand for a whole load of others, perhaps even more of itself, this
							means that when 'C' unpacks to 'aCa' if you unpack it again you get 'aaCaa'. If you were to unpack this genome 5
							times, you'd end up with 'aaaaaCaaaaa' when the plant was only born with the Genome 'C'. This means that a small
							mutation in a seeds genome can lead to a radically different unpacked genome, therefore a radically different plant.</p>
						<p>As real plants use a similar mechanism as they grow, I hope that this will lead to more interesting plant shapes
							evolving.</p>

						<p>The shapes that plants evolve into still appear limited, though they simply take a long time to evolve.
							Branching forms require a long genome, the standard genome length is 0 (grow up once). This means that it takes time

						<p>Work on v2.0 is progressing, the gene editor is being implemented and the ability to save and load genes and
							simulation settings has been implemented.</p>
						<p>I've also implemented different size classes of plants, my hope is that it will encourage a larger variety of
							forms, small bushy forms under the canopy and tall stemmed, branching forms making the canopy.</p>
						<p>While interesting plant shapes are certainly possible, I've noticed that plants tend towards a tall, single
							stemmed shape. This could be caused by a few things but the way the genes work is a likely culprit, it might require
							too much order to maintain a branched structure, which is easily lost leading to far inferior offspring. In evolution
							you can be as fit for the environment as you like, but if most of your children are unfit, your genes are likely to
							die out.</p>

						<p>This project is my first published program, it models the growth and reproduction of plants. Each plant has a
							set of genes which dictate how it will grow and it passes these onto its offspring, with a chance for mutations to
							occur. It is a genetic algorithm where the fitness function isn't a direct calculation, instead the fitness of a plant
							can be considered to be the number of descendants it has, much like real life.</p>
						<p>The genes don't absolutely describe the shape that the plant will grow into, they're just a set of rules that
							the plant follows as it grows, namely how long to grow stems and how many branches to grow at each level of the plant.</p>
						<p>The plants compete for light, which falls from the sky as photons, and for space, a seed cannot germinate if it
