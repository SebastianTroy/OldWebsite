			<div class="content">
				<p>This projects aims to model plant evolution through natural selection. It does this by simulating an environment
					in which plant like entities grow and reproduce, while competing for light and space.</p>
				<p>In normal genetic algorithms there are distinct stages or generations:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Generate a random population.</li>
					<li>Test them all using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">fitness function</a>.
					</li>
					<li>Select a fit portion of the population, based on the fitness function.</li>
					<li>Create the next generation from the fit individuals, usually by copying them and adding small mutations to
						some.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In this program however there is no fitness function and there are no set generations. Instead the fitness of an
					individual can be considered to be how many offspring it manages to have. There is no equivalent to generations because,
					as in real life, some plants will outlive others and successfully have offspring before or after each other.</p>
				<p>In any situation where you have variation in a population, inheritable traits, mutation and variable survival you
					will get evolution, it is unavoidable and can be applied in any situation in which those traits all exist together.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p>Each plant is represented by lines and circles. Each line is a stem and the circle is a leaf. Light shines
							directly down from the top of the simulation and if shown, casts shadows beneath the plant.</p>
						<p>The light is coloured and depending on the colour of the leaf, only certain colours of light will be blocked by
							the leaf. A red leaf casts a red shadow, meaning that it has absorbed all of the green and blue light, any plants
							trying to grow in a red shadow need to be able to absorb red light to survive, as there is no blue or green light
							left.
						<p>Plants start as seeds, these will germinate if there is enough space for them and grow into a full grown plant.
							Once fully grown, any excess energy a plant has goes into making more seeds, which it will drop from its leaves.</p>
						<p>As plants age they use up more energy, their metabolism increases. This leaves less excess energy for creating
							more seeds and eventually causes the plant to die, creating space in the simulation for new seeds to germinate.</p>

					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">The Genetics</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>
							A plant's genes are represented by a string of characters, each of which is a single instruction. To decide the shape
							of a plant each instruction is read in turn, these instructions create a <a
								href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=node+tree&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-GB:%7Breferrer:source%7D&ie=UTF-8&oe=&gws_rd=ssl">node
								tree</a> which is 'crawled' by a 'robot'. The robot can crawl up and down the tree, from node to node, and each
							instruction that is read out is applied to the node that the robot is currently at.
						</p>
						<p>At the end of the instructions, any nodes which don't have any children become leaves.</p>
						<p>Each of the instructions is listed below:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>^</b> : Make the current node grow up one unit.</li>
							<li><b>v</b> : Make the current node grow down one unit.</li>
							<li><b>&lt;</b> : Make the current node grow left one unit</li>
							<li><b>&gt;</b> : Make the current node grow right one unit.</li>
							<li><b>N</b> : Create a new node, whose parent is the current node and crawl to it.</li>
							<li><b>S</b> : Toggle whether the current node can produce seeds.</li>
							<li><b>+</b> : Crawl up the node tree to the youngest child node.</li>
							<li><b>-</b> : Crawl down the node tree to the parent node.</li>
							<li><b>|</b> : Ignore all further instructions.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For example, for the genes: '^ N &lt; - N >'</p>
						<img src="projects/evolving-plants/img/demonstration.gif" />
						<ol>
							<li>All plants start as a one unit tall stem with a leaf.</li>
							<li>Grow up, making the plant two units tall</li>
							<li>Create a new node, which increases the height to three units and leaves a parent node one unit below it.</li>
							<li>Grow Left, making the current node grow one to the left, note this doesn't move the node below it.</li>
							<li>Crawl back down the tree to the parent node.</li>
							<li>Create a new node, this will grow up a unit and overlap the other child node.</li>
							<li>Grow right, this moves the newest node one unit to the right, leaving a plant that is three units high with
								two leaves at the top, one in the centre and one to the right.</li>

						<p>A run through of what each button does:</p>
						<div class="box_break"></div>
						<p>Simulation Speed menu:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Warp Speed: </b>This doesn't change how the simulation works, it simply causes multiple steps of the
								simulation to be calculated between each time it is drawn. It greatly increases the speed at which the simulation
								progresses.</li>
							<li><b>Playback Speed: </b>The simulation works by knowing how many seconds have passed between each step, this
								option allows you to tweak this number, telling the simulation that half, or twice as many seconds have gone past.
								This information is used to calculate how much a plant should have grown since the last step, how far a seed should
								have fallen. <strong>Warning: </strong>if your computer is very slow and this value is high, strange things can
								happen in the simulation. A seed can germinate, grow and die in a single step, because the simulation thinks so much
								time has passed. This can lead to extinction as plants do not have enough time to produce seeds before dying.</li>
							<li><b>Reset Simulation: </b>Clears all plants and filters from the simulation, does not change simulation
								settings.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="box_break"></div>
						<p>Interactions menu:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Select Plants: </b>Allows the user to click on a leaf to select a plant, the plant is then highlighted. At
								this time there is no further use for this feature.</li>
							<li><b>Plant Seeds: </b>Allows the user to place seeds in the simulation. They are based on the current genes, or
								the default genes if no other genes have been extracted or loaded.</li>
							<li><b>Extract Genes: </b>Allows the user to get genes from a plant, by clicking on one of its leaves, which then
								can be saved or used with the plant seeds option.</li>
							<li><b>Kill Plants: </b>Allows the user to remove a plants from the simulation by clicking on a plant's leaf or
								clicking and dragging through multiple plant leaves.</li>
							<li><b>Move Filters: </b>Allows the user to move a light filter, by clicking and dragging on one of its handles.
								(See Filter Options menu below)</li>
							<li><b>Delete Filters: </b>Allows the user to remove a light filter, by clicking on one of its handles. (See
								Filter Options menu below)</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="box_break"></div>
						<p>Plant Options menu:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Leaf Size: </b>Leaf size is set for a plant when it germinates, leaves will grow to be as large as this
								setting.</li>
							<li><b>Stalk Length: </b>This denotes the size of each growth unit. A plant that grows three units tall will be
								three stalk lengths high. (See 'The Genetics' above for details on what a unit means.)</li>
							<li><b>Chance of Mutant Offspring (%): </b>When a plant produces a seed the DNA it passes on is identical to its
								own, unless it is mutated. This setting is the chance of a seed inheriting mutated DNA.</li>
							<li><b>Damage to Mutant DNA (%): </b>This represents the proportion of DNA which will be affected by mutation.
								DNA with 50 instructions exposed to a 10% mutation will on average gain 5 mutations.</li>

							<li><b>Plant is [size] if Bigger Than: </b> These are shown by dotted lines across the screen, a plant's size
								category is decided purely by its height. You can easily tell a plant's height category by seeing which line it is
								growing above.</li>
							<li><b>[size] plant Spacing: </b>For a seed to germinate it needs space. A large seed will only germinate if it
								is far away enough from all other large plants. The distance a seed needs to be from other plants of its own size
								category is decided here.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="box_break"></div>
						<p>Light Options menu:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Show Light: </b> This option pauses the simulation and gives a graphical representation of the light
								levels and colours in the simulation. Here you can observe shadows cast by plants and light filters.</li>
							<li><b>Light Intensity: </b> These sliders allow you to control how much of each colour of light enters the
								simulation. Removing all blue light from the simulation can tend to lead towards the evolution of blue leaved plants,
								i.e. plants that absorb and use all colours except blue, however other factors can influence leaf colour.</li>
							<li><b>Leaf Transparency: </b>When set to 0, leaves remove all light they can and cast a shadow of the same
								colour as their leaves. At 100 the leaves still collect the same energy from the light they are receiving but they do
								not cast shadows.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="box_break"></div>
						<p>Filter Options menu:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Filter Width: </b>The width of a filter can be anywhere between 0 and the width of the entire simulation.</li>
							<li><b>Colour Sliders: </b>The colour shadow that a filter will produce is decided by these sliders.</li>
							<li><b>Create Filter: </b>Creates a filter with the settings denoted by the above sliders, the filter is placed
								in the simulation at half the height starting at the leftmost point of the simulation currently being observed..</li>

						<p>I've always thought that the older versions, while slow and full of unnecessary features, managed to capture
							something that the newer program did not. The new program has to be run at ridiculously high speeds in order to
							observe evolution happening and then it is usually very stochastic and leads to very boring shapes emerging.</p>
						<p>For that reason I've revisited one of the older programs, the one that simulates recombination of genetic
							material from two parents</p>
						<p>So far the progress has mostly been updating it to use a newer version of my interface library and removing a
							few features that don't add anything to the simulation.</p>

						<p>I've been playing around with the way that genes work and the result is this new branch of the program. It is
							based on 2.0 but completely changes the way that genes work. The genes still define the exact shape that the plant
							will grow into but they are far more simple and complex at the same time.</p>
						<p>The idea is that some characters in a gene stand for a whole load of others, perhaps even more of itself, this
							means that when 'C' unpacks to 'aCa' if you unpack it again you get 'aaCaa'. If you were to unpack this genome 5
							times, you'd end up with 'aaaaaCaaaaa' when the plant was only born with the Genome 'C'. This means that a small
							mutation in a seeds genome can lead to a radically different unpacked genome, therefore a radically different plant.</p>
						<p>As real plants use a similar mechanism as they grow, I hope that this will lead to more interesting plant shapes
							evolving.</p>

						<p>Work on v2.0 is progressing, the gene editor is being implemented and the ability to save and load genes and

						<p>While interesting plant shapes are certainly possible, I've noticed that plants tend towards a tall, single

						<p>I have copied the program and tweaked it slightly so that plants reproduce sexually, i.e. they exchange genetic
							information and their offspring is based on both parents. Plants won't breed with each other unless they are vaguely
							related allowing for speciation to occur.</p>

						<p>Key features of this build are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Plants reproduce sexually (if possible), with other members of their own species.</li>
							<li>A plants species is kept track of using a string of digits, a member of the same species is counted as an
								individual whose species digits only have a small number of differences.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>This project is my first published program, it models the growth and reproduction of plants. Each plant has a
							set of genes which dictate how it will grow and it passes these onto its offspring, with a chance for mutations to
							occur. It is a genetic algorithm where the fitness function isn't a direct calculation, instead the fitness of a plant
							can be considered to be the number of descendants it has, much like real life.</p>
						<p>The genes don't absolutely describe the shape that the plant will grow into, they're just a set of rules that
							the plant follows as it grows, namely how long to grow stems and how many branches to grow at each level of the plant.</p>
						<p>The plants compete for light, which falls from the sky as photons, and for space, a seed cannot germinate if it
							is too close to another plant.</p>

						<p>Key features of this build are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Simulation split into two halves in which parameters can be individually modified.</li>
							<li>Plants grow and reproduce, competing for light and space.</li>
							<li>Plants can be selected, their genes can be modified, they can be removed and seeds can be planted.</li>
