			<h1 class="box_heading">Model of an Incompressible Fluid</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
					This project is a spin-off from the modelling work I did for my undergraduate dissertation. The model aims to represent
					an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_flow">incompressible fluid</a>, in a computationally quick but
					physically realistic manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					The water is simulated using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a>, the arrows
					represent the direction and speed of flow at a particular point in the simulation and the particles act as tracers for
					individual molecules of the fluid.
				</p>
				<p>
					The method I used is based on work done by Jos Stam, his original document can be found <a
						href="http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf">here</a>.

					<div class="content">
						<p>An example of an almost incompressible fluid is water. This program is only in two dimensions so imagine you are
							looking through the side of a very thin tank of water, the blue dots are like small beads which neither float or sink
							in the water, they only move when the water around them moves. The arrows are like threads stuck to the glass, when
							the water flows over them, they point in the direction of the flow, the stronger the flow, the bigger the arrows get.</p>
						<p>There are a set number of particles (blue dots) in the water, however they don't take up any space, they can be
							on top of each other, so if they are all in the same place, they fill only a single pixel of the screen and can be
							very hard to see.</p>

					<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">The Interface</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>A quick run through of what each button and slider does:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To interact with the fluid, simply click and drag the mouse cursor through the model.</li>
							<li><b>Vector line Density</b>: This only controls how many of the vectors are drawn, it doesn't change the
								number of vectors being modelled.</li>
							<li><b>Time between Calculations (s)</b>: This adds a delay, in seconds, between each step of the model, this
								slows the speed at which the model is calculated and drawn.</li>
							<li><b>Iterations of linear solving</b>: This variable is more complex. If your computer can handle it, 6 is a
								good value. Anything below 6 results in unrealistic and less interesting behaviour of the fluid however on older
								computers it might be necessary to turn it down as it is a major bottleneck.</li>
							<li><b>Particle diffusion</b>: If the fluid is completely still, the particles (blue dots) wouldn't move
								anywhere, also sometimes they can all bunch up on top of each other. To prevent this we can give them a small amount
								of random movement each step of the simulation. This variable represents the maximum number of pixels a particle
								might move in the x and y dimension each step.</li>
							<li><b>Particle brightness</b>: Allows the choice of a particle colour between white and blue.</li>

						<p>While I logged a lot of my progress alongside my dissertation, it was actually based on marine plankton ecology.
							This means that fluid dynamics was a small part of the project and the majority of the information in my log book is
							irrelevant to this application.</p>
						<p>I did my main model in 3D but to help me implement the fluid dynamics a I used 2D testing environment which I
							extracted and made more user friendly, the result of which is this project.</p>
						<p>I intend to clean the project up further, adding options to make all of the edges solid, or wrap them all, and
							also to allow the user to specify how good their machine is, and adjust the size of the matrix and the number of
							particles accordingly.</p>
