				<p>
					This project is based on the classic arcade game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">PONG</a> and came about as
					a 1 hour programming challenge. I completed the challenge with a working version of the game however with all my
					projects I immediately wanted to improve on it. Unfortunately I did not save a copy of the original version however the
					oldest version documented is very close in looks, if not source code.

						<p>
							For those of you who haven't played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">PONG</a> before, the idea is to stop
							the ball from hitting your side of the screen. You do this by moving a paddle on your side to intercept the ball,
							causing it to bounce back towards your opponent.

						<p>I'm intending to re add the visual effects lost from the previous version. I'm also hoping to re-engineer the
							AI, perhaps utilising a neural net.</p>
						<p>The new version will likely be in a language other than Java, perhaps javascript so it can be played online.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p>A very simple first version of the program. It was written for an older version of the TCode library therefore
							some of the motion effects are lost, due to changes in frame rate monitoring and control.</p>
						<p>The AI is fairly simple and follows the ball back and forth, however it isn't perfect. Over time small random
							mutations to it's alignment add up to a miss. There is a small chance for alignment to be fixed, it is the size of
							this chance which governs the difficulty of the AI.</p>
