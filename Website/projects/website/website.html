						<p>This constitutes my first development log written on this site, over the last 11 months I have heavily focused
							my attention on my university work and my finals, however over the last few days the page has really come a long way.
							I've settled on a layout, I've battled cross browser glitches and I've greatly improved my skills in Javascript and
							PHP.</p>
						<p>I'm fairly happy with the design of the site, and while I know it is a little unconventional, I think it is
							clean and efficient and allows for bite-sized portions of information, which are easily focused on within the sea of
							data present. Being colour-blind, I've relied heavily on the suggestions from others on the colour scheme however I
							have not had a great consensus from all, and am naturally unsure of the current scheme!</p>

						<p>My main achievements for this build are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The website is responsive, The site should be easily accessible and uncluttered on all sized screens,</li>
							<li>Content is divided up into boxes, each of which can be minimised and maximised by clicking on the box's
								title,</li>
							<li>The website 'fails gracefully', if an older browser doesn't support a feature or if Javascript is disabled
								the website still functions as intended.</li>
							<li>The website displays correctly on all up to date browsers, old browsers are also compatible however minor
								cosmetic changes occur for IE versions less than 8.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I've been meaning to make a website for a very long time, I'm hoping that it will allow me to create more
							interactive content and provide a neater way to include extensive development logs. The website will also be a project
							in its own right and hopefully will act both as a portfolio for my work and a prime example of it too.</p>
						<p>I have so far only played around with some HTML and CSS, I've also made a temporary logo in paint, the result is
							hideous and unhosted but I'm looking into hosting it on my dropbox or even Github!</p>
						<p>From the image below you can see the seeds of the current design taking shape, though it is /very/ basic!</p>
