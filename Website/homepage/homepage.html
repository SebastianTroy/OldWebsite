					This website hosts many of my <a href="projects.php">projects</a>, both small and large, and is a portfolio of sorts.
					Most of them are written in Java and all of them are <a href="https://github.com/SebastianTroy?tab=repositories">open source</a>. This
					website is still in its infancy so will be updated regularly.
