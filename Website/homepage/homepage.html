					This website plays host to my many of my <a href="projects.php">projects</a>, both small and
					large, and is a portfolio of sorts. Most of them are written in Java and all of them are <a
						href="https://github.com/SebastianTroy">open source</a>. This website is still in its infancy
					so expect regular updates, also, now that I've finished University, I'm hoping to have more time
					to dedicate new and exciting endeavours.
