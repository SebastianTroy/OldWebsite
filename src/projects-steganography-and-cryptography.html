								<p>
									<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> is the art of hiding
									information in images, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a> is the
									practice of hiding information from
									adversaries. I was interested in creating an unbreakable and undetectable encryption so I began by
									looking into 1) how
									information was discerned from noise and 2) how codes were cracked.
								</p>
								<p>Basically both of those problems are the same, Hidden information is found and codes are cracked by
									finding
									patterns. This can be got around by having no pattern, or at least having so many ways to encode
									each letter of the
									alphabet, each character is encoded in a unique hash. In this way, a long string of encoded Zs would
									not leave a
									repeating pattern which could be detected.</p>
								<p>The information is encoded 16 bits of data, therefore 65536 different unique characters can be
									encoded, if we only
									want to encode 26 letters of the alphabet, spaces and some character to signify the end of the
									message, that leaves us
									with 2340 possible permutations per letter. The information is then hidden in the images in a 4x4
									pixel grid pattern.
									Each pixel in the image is represented by an integer which can be odd or even, if you read even as 0
									and odd as 1 you
									have binary information.</p>
								<p>28 unique characters can be stored using only 5 bits of data, therefore the process of increasing the
									number of
									bits used to store each character could be seen as hashing. To convert a message into string of
									hashes, a neural network
									and backwards engineering is used. A random 16bit configuration is chosen, passed through the neural
									net and the if it
									is needed, the character it represents is inserted into the message, this process is repeated until
									each character in
									the message has a random 16 bit hash assigned. This makes decrypting the message easy, if you have
									the correct neural
									network, simply pass each hash through the network and voila, your secret message!</p>
								<p>Of course, if you don't have the neural network, all you'll see is an image, and even if you know
									there is a
									message inside it, the chances of the message containing two identical 16 bit hashes is small. A
									message which is 3000
									characters long would therefore look like it was written in a language which used 3000 letters in
									its alphabet. The
									network used to create the hashes is highly sensitive to even small tweaks to its structure, so much
									so that even a
									single node with an altered threshold will output gibberish that is impossible to replicate without
									the original
									parameters.</p>

										<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">Simple instructions</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<ul>
												<li>Rename a .png or .jpg to a message that you want hidden inside it</li>
												<li>For ease of use, move the image into the same folder as the program</li>
												<li>Run the program, select the image and click "OK"</li>
												<li>Click "Cancel" to finish or select another file to encode it as well</li>
												<li>You will find your image has been renamed, you can now change it to whatever you like
													and your secret message
													is safe</li>
												<li>To retrieve your message Run the program again Select the image and click "OK"</li>
												<li>You will find your image has been renamed back to the original message that you encoded
													(minus punctuation or
													capital letters).</li>
											</ul>

										<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">Advanced instructions</h2>
										<div class="content">
											<p>To run the program from a command line or console, open the console to the location of the
												program and type
												"java -jar Encrypto.jar" You can also add extra arguments to the JVM for extra features of
												the program, "java -jar
												[add your arguments here] Encrypto.jar" these are:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>'-Dseed=integer' This allows you to specify your own seed, used to construct the Neural
													Network, messages
													encoded with a seed can only be decoded with exactly the same seed allowing for
													"passkey" protected messages (default
													value if unspecified == 1198662804)</li>
												<li>'-Dleeway=float' This allows you to control the inner workings of the Network used to
													encode and decode
													messages, again changing this value will change how the network translates information.
													This value is very sensitive
													and it is recommended that you use some of the other modes in order to refine this
													variable if you intend to change
													it. (default value if unspecified == 0.07)</li>
												<li>'-Dmode=mode' This allows you to change what mode the program is run in which are:
													<ul>
														<li><b>dictionary</b>, this mode simply cycles through every combination 16 bits can
															represent and prints out
															the character that the Network represents it as. This can be helpful in
															assessing how randomly our Network is
															assigning characters to our 16 bit combinations</li>
														<li><b>stats</b>, this mode calculates the frequency of combinations that represent
															each letter of the
															alphabet, it then prints out the Standard Deviation of the frequencies and also
															an array representing the % of
															combinations used for each letter. A pseudo random distribution of frequencies
															would result in a standard deviation
															of roughly 100 though 400 is a good number to aim for when choosing a seed.</li>
														<li><b>optimise</b>, this mode allows you to search for a seed with a low standard
															deviation for a particular
															setup, you can specify the 'levels' used in the Network and the 'leeway' with
															the above parameters.</li>
														<li><b>graph</b>, this mode draws a graph to an image and saves it to your desktop.
															This mode is most useful
															for narrowing down an appropriate 'leeway' value. The graph shows the standard
															deviation for a range of Networks
															with leeway set between:
															<ul>
																<li>'-Dminleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.0)</li>
																<li>'-Dmaxleeway' (default if unspecified == 0.4)</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul>

											<p>This version is very simple, in the future I intend to make it more user friendly however it
												works and for now I
												need to concentrate on Uni work.</p>
											<p>Messages can be hidden in messages and retrieved from them. The program reads any information
												hidden in the
												message and grabs the name of the image and then swaps them round, hiding the name in the
												image and renaming it to
												anything hidden in the image.</p>
