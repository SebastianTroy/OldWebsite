								<p>
									The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman
										problem</a> is basically: how
									to visit every city once, taking the shortest route between them. This problem has a lot of
									relevance still today, for
									example, postal routes and rubbish disposal routes e.t.c.
								</p>
								<p>
									This project uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill climber</a> algorithm
									to approximate the
									solution, this is much faster than using brute force to check every possible route for the shortest
									solution. The basic
									premise of a hill climber algorithm is that you start with a sub optimal solution, usually a random
									one, then you mutate
									it, if the mutated solution is better you keep it, if not, you undo the mutation and try again. This
									leads to a
									ratcheting effect where the solution can only ever get better. Due to the introduction of random
									mutation which are
									selected on, leading to an improvement over time, the hill climber is considered a genetic
									algorithm, albeit a very
									simple one.

								<p>Once the website is completed this project is a prime candidate for my first "Javascript + HTML5
									Canvas" project,
									that would mean you could try it out on this website, instead of needing to download it.</p>

									<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">What Am I Looking At?</h2>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Each blue circle on the screen represents a city. The white arrows that form a path between
											the cities are the
											'tour'.</p>
										<p>Whenever a city is added, it is added to the tour, meaning all cities are linked by the tour
											at all times. To
											start with the tour will follow a random path between all of the cities, the program will be
											constantly looking for a
											shorter path and will update the tour whenever it finds one.</p>
										<p>At the top of the screen are some numbers:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Improved [x] seconds ago</b>This counts how many seconds it has been since the last
												improvement to the
												tour was found.</li>
											<li><b>Generation: </b>This is the number of 'generations' i.e. the number of times the
												genetic algorithm has
												been run on the current tour, this is reset every time the user modifies the number or
												location of the cities.</li>
											<li><b>Improvements: </b>This is the number of generations in which the mutation to the tour
												has shortened it. As
												time goes by and more improvements are made, it becomes harder to find a beneficial
												mutation and therefore the rate
												at which improvements are made will decrease.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>At the bottom of the screen, next to the "Next Method" button, there is a box. The writing in
											the box describes
											the current type of mutation being used by the genetic algorithm.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="box">
									<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">Types of Mutation</h2>
									<div class="content">
										<p>How the different types of mutation work can be a little confusing, so here are two
											explanations of how they
											work:</p>
										<p>A technical description of the process:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Randomise city position: </b>A single city is chosen at random, the cities before and
												after it in the tour
												are joined and it is reinserted into the tour between another two cities.</li>
											<li><b>Randomise city positions: </b>The above mutation is performed between 2 and n times,
												where n is the length
												of the entire tour.</li>
											<li><b>Reverse direction of tour section: </b>This method takes a small section of the tour
												and 'untwists' it.
												Analogous to having a rubber band in a figure 8 and untwisting one side to make it a
												figure 0. This method is great
												at removing crossed paths.</li>
											<li><b>Move one end of tour: </b>This method cuts a random number of cities off the end of a
												tour, reverses the
												order of the route between them and then sticks the old end into the tour where the cut
												was made.</li>
											<li><b>Swap two cities: </b>This method chooses two random cities and then the cities before
												each of them in the
												tour are swapped round and the cities after them in the tour are swapped.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>An abstract representation of the changes, ABC means a tour from city A to city B to City C:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Randomise city position: </b>A<b>B</b>CDE -> ACD<b>B</b>E</li>
											<li><b>Randomise city positions: </b>A<b>B</b>C<b>DE</b> -> A<b>E</b>C<b>BD</b></li>
											<li><b>Reverse direction of tour section: </b>A<b>BCD</b>E -> A<b>DCB</b>E</li>
											<li><b>Move one end of tour: </b>AB<b>CDE</b> -> AB<b>EDC</b></li>
											<li><b>Swap two cities: </b>A<b>B</b>C<b>D</b>E -> A<b>D</b>C<b>B</b>E</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="box">
									<h2 class="box_heading start_minimised">The Interface</h2>
									<div class="content">
										<p>A quick run through of what each button does:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Remove All Cities: </b>This button resets the entire program.</li>
											<li><b>Reset Solution: </b>This button leaves all cities in the same place but resets the
												route the tour takes to
												a random one.</li>
											<li><b>Add Random City: </b>This button adds a city at a random location on the screen and
												adds it into the tour
												at a random location. <i>This will reset the Generations and Improvements counters.</i>
											</li>
											<li><b>Add 10 Random Cities: </b>This button is equivalent to pressing the previous button
												10 times in
												succession.</li>
											<li><b>Add 6 * 6 Grid: </b>This button adds 36 cities, evenly spaced to form a grid. It will
												not remove any
												cities that are already present. <i>This will reset the Generations and Improvements
													counters.</i></li>
											<li><b>Add 10 * 10 Grid: </b>This button adds 100 cities, evenly spaced to form a grid. It
												will not remove any
												cities that are already present. <i>This will reset the Generations and Improvements
													counters.</i></li>
											<li><b>Loop Tour: </b>This checkbox allows the user to toggle whether the first and last
												cities in the tour are
												joined.</li>
										</ul>
										<div class="box_break"></div>
										<ul>
											<li><b>New City: </b>When this option is selected, a new city is placed wherever the user
												clicks. <i>This
													will reset the Generations and Improvements counters.</i></li>
											<li><b>Move City: </b>When this option is selected, The user can click on and then drag
												existing cities around,
												if a city is dragged off screen it is removed from the tour. <i>This will reset the
													Generations and Improvements
													counters.</i></li>
											<li><b>Delete City: </b>When this option is selected, any city that the user clicks on will
												be removed from the
												tour. <i>This will reset the Generations and Improvements counters.</i></li>
										</ul>
										<div class="box_break"></div>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Pause: </b>When selected, the algorithm is not run. The user can still interact with
												the cities, placing,
												deleting and moving them, however the tour will not be changed and the type of mutation
												currently being used will not
												cycle automatically.</li>
											<li><b>Automatic?: </b>When selected, they type of mutation being used by the algorithm will
												cycle through a list
												of possible mutations. When set to automatic, the type of mutation will change every
												2000 generations.</li>
											<li><b>Next Method: </b>This button allows the user to manually cycle through the current
												type of mutation being
												used by the algorithm.</li>

										<p>Before publishing this project on my website I wanted to make sure that it was completely bug
											free and easy to
											use. I also noticed that most TSP solvers work with a complete circuit, so I added the
											option to seamlessly toggle
											between a tour which loops back to the starting city, and one which does not.</p>

										<p>This update represents a large improvement in terms of the front and back end of the program.
										</p>
										<p>The user interface has been made much simpler, instead of pressing keys it is now possible to
											interact with the
											mouse.</p>
										<p>
											The structure of the program has also been significantly cleaned up, improving efficiency
											massively and allowing for
											the genetic algorithm to apply more intricate mutations to the tour. This means that there
											are no longer any local
											optima in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape">fitness landscape</a>
											and the algorithm can
											never get stuck with a sub-optimal solution forever.
										</p>
										<p>
											While technically possible to evolve a perfect solution in every situation, if there are
											100s of cities in a tour, it
											might take a <b>very</b> long time to untangle particular sub-optimal sections of a route.
