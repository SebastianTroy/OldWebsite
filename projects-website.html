										<p>This constitutes my first development log written on this site, over the last 11 months I
											have heavily focused
											my attention on my university work and my finals, however over the last few days the page
											has really come a long way.
											I've settled on a layout, I've battled cross browser glitches and I've greatly improved my
											skills in Javascript and
											PHP.</p>
										<p>I'm fairly happy with the design of the site, and while I know it is a little unconventional,
											I think it is
											clean and efficient and allows for bite-sized portions of information, which are easily
											focused on within the sea of
											data present. Being colour-blind, I've relied heavily on the suggestions from others on the
											colour scheme however I
											have not had a great consensus from all, and am naturally unsure of the current scheme!</p>

											data-title="On wide screens there are two columns of content which automatically rearrange themselves as the page changes dimesion and content is minimised.">
											<img src="/projects/website/img/website082014.png" class="thumbnail" alt="View Image" />
										</a> <a href="/projects/website/img/website082014tablet.png" data-lightbox="website082014"
											data-title="On a thinner screen the two columns of content collapse into a single one.">
											<img src="/projects/website/img/website082014tablet.png" class="thumbnail"
												alt="View Image" />
										</a>
										<div class="box_break"></div>
										<p>My main achievements for this build are:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The website is responsive, The site should be easily accessible and uncluttered on all
												sized screens,</li>
											<li>Content is divided up into boxes, each of which can be minimised and maximised by
												clicking on the box's
												title,</li>
											<li>The website 'fails gracefully', if an older browser doesn't support a feature or if
												Javascript is disabled
												the website still functions as intended.</li>
											<li>The website displays correctly on all up to date browsers, old browsers are also
												compatible however minor
												cosmetic changes occur for IE versions less than 8.</li>
										</ul>

											<i>This content has been moved over from my blogger account</i>
										</p>
										<p>I've been meaning to make a website for a very long time, I'm hoping that it will allow me to
											create more
											interactive content and provide a neater way to include extensive development logs. The
											website will also be a project
											in its own right and hopefully will act both as a portfolio for my work and a prime example
											of it too.</p>
										<p>I have so far only played around with some HTML and CSS, I've also made a temporary logo in
											paint, the result is
											hideous and unhosted but I'm looking into hosting it on my dropbox or even Github!</p>
										<p>From the image below you can see the seeds of the current design taking shape, though it is
											/very/ basic!</p>
